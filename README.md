### Analysis_of_USA_housing_price_and_type

### The rental price of a house involves many aspects, which also decide by the value of itself; whatâ€™s more, since houses are sorted by types, different house types, including apartment, condo, loft,etc., also could be regarded as a standard to determine the house rental price. To figure out the relationship between all of these, some process of classification, several methods were applied in this report, such as KNN, SVM, random tree model. Finally, based on this dataset, the best approach from the machine learning methods was defined as Random Forest. In other words, based on the dataset, Random Forest could tell more things about house price and could play a vital role in further research and experiment.
